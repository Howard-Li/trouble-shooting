when using PyCharm to update libraries, I get the error message: 
attributeerror: 'module' object has no attribute 'geteuid'

took me an hour to figure it our!

solution:
go to your python directory, for example, C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pip
open and edit basecommand.py and download.py
search for "os.geteuid()" (double quotations not included)
then add single quotation to it. For example, the original line is :
  write_debug_log = check_path_owner(debug_log_path, os.geteuid())
what you should have is:
  write_debug_log = check_path_owner(debug_log_path, 'os.geteuid()')

that's it. Just edit these *two* python files and the problem is solved.

Welcome to discuss the reason behind this.
